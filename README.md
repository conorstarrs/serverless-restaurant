# serverless-restaurant
Sample CQRS example using AWS Lambda and the Serverless framework.

## Building & Deploying
```bash
brew bundle
npm install -g serverless
sls login
open https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/
aws configure
aws ssm put-parameter --name accountId --type String --value <your-12-digit-account-id> --region us-east-1
cd menu
npm install
sls dynamodb install
sls deploy
cd ../customers
npm install
sls dynamodb install
sls deploy
cd ../orders
npm install
sls dynamodb install
sls deploy
```

Every deploy (`sls deploy`) will create a Serverless instance that can be managed through a [dashboard](https://platform.serverless.com/). Find sample command/query requests in the `smoke.sh` file in each service directory. To see the database, access the [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

To run the services locally, start the Serverless offline server:
```bash
SLS_DEBUG=* sls offline start
```
